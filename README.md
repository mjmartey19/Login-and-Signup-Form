# Login-and-Signup-Form
A login form is a web page or a section of a web page where users enter their username and password to gain access to a particular service or website. It is usually used as a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to a website or online service.

A signup form, on the other hand, is a web page or a section of a web page where users can create a new account or register for a particular service or website. It typically collects information such as the user's name, email address, and password, and may also include other details like the user's date of birth, address, or phone number.

Both the login and signup forms are essential components of a website or web application, and they are commonly used in various industries, including e-commerce, social media, online banking, and more.
